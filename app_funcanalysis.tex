\chapter{Functionality Analysis}

\section{Functionality analysis methodology}
A functionality analysis looks at how well an application meets the requirements of the user. A high level programming like C++ or Python is very functional, but is not usable without considerable time and developmental resources. While a programming language could meet the user's need - eventually - but it is impractical to use, especially if a rapid solution is needed.

Software being used to meet current EPL requirements were measured using six criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Enterprise} measured whether the application was deployed on a server for shared access or installed on a personal workstation only. Enterprise applications received a 1, while desktop applications received a -1. 
\item \textbf{Metadata} measured the applications ability to accept and store metadata and secondary information such as chain of custody and user access. Systems that could handle or collect metadata received a 1 while systems that coudl not received -1.
\item \textbf{Configured} measured how well the application could be customized to local users needs. A configurable system that was tailored to specific KEPA requirement and country specific parameters received a 1. Non configurable systems for general use received a -1. It could be argued that Excel is configurable, however it would require considerable effort to design a specific application from it, in which case it would not be Excel, but an Excel application.
\item \textbf{Raw Data} evaluated the ability of the system to receive raw data and process it before using it for reports. Allows for the ability to check data for errors and produce TCD. A system that could receive raw data was awarded a 1, a system that could not received -1. Systems that could handle some forms of raw data received a 0.
\item \textbf{Search} described the ability of the application to search for specific records and past datasets. Systems with search or query functions received a 1 while systems without received -1.
\item \textbf{Completeness} measured the built in functionality specific to the requirement. Completeness is for individual systems is described below in Table \ref{completeness}. Systems with full functionality relative to EPL requirements received a 2, while systems that had partial requirements received a 1 or 0. Systems that did not meet any requirements received a -1.
\end{itemize}

The individual scores for each category were summed for a total score. Functionality assessment was awarded based on the the total score as shown in Table \ref{tab:funcrange}.

\section{Completeness score}
The Completeness score was determined by assigning functional criteria to each requirement and scoring the requirement with a 1 (meets the requirement) or 0 (does not meet the requirement). The criteria scores are added up and compared to the maximum score (total number of criteria).  The percentage of the score to the maximum forms the basis of award as shown below where $x$ is the percentage of the score divided by the maximum value.

\centering
\begin{tabular}{l}
$x = 100\% \rightarrow 2$ \\
$100\% <x \ge50\% \rightarrow 1$ \\
$0<x <50\%\rightarrow 0 $\\
$x=0\rightarrow -1$
\end{tabular}


The Completeness scores are shown in Table \ref{tab:completeness}.
