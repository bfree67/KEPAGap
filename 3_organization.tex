\section{KEPA requirements}

KEPA recently underwent an organizational change in October 2017 in order to establish a better internal structure that could meet their responsibilities under the EPL. This chapter describes the new structure and the environmental information requirements of each office within the new organization.  During the course of collecting data for this report, several of the office heads and staff were interviewed and given an online survey to complete.
