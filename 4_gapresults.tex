\section{Required EIS functionality}

Key to evaluating the gaps in the current KEPA EIS environment is to identify the requirements KEPA needs in order to properly function. Based on the requirements of the EPL, certain functions are implied. Additionally, other functions are implied based on the work flows of different departments and best management practices from other national environmental agencies. Table \ref{tab:eisrqmt} shows a summary of required databases (DBs) and the articles within the EPL driving the requirement. Some databases, like Chemical and Waste Mgmt may share multiple functions such as facility IDs, industrial sector IDs, and chemical IDs. A common requirement for all DBs is the ability to associate datasets with a geospatial location that can identify it in a physical location. Some DB requirements not directly pertaining to environmental information, such as the Legal DB, Financial Mgmt DB, and Planning/Project DB were dropped from the analysis as out of scope. Their importance should not be discounted however.

Based on the requirements established in Table \ref{tab:eisrqmt}, a functionality review of existing systems was conducted to determine if the existing systems had the functionality required to meet the KEPA responsibilities under EPL. The results were rated using the scoring system in Table \ref{tab:funcclass}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Evaluation rating system for section information system functionality.}

No system deployed to meet requirements & N/A \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table} 

Additional EIS requirements were added - LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System). This is required to manage equipment status and samples in the laboratories and statistical analysis software. While not specifically called out in the EPL, LIMS is essential to conduct analytical chemistry in support of the other activities, while statistical software is required for more complete analysis. The complete functionality analysis based required functions to meet the EPL is provided in Appendix B. The EPL functionality analysis summary is shown in Table \ref{tab:eplfunc}.

\end{table}

Of the 23 EIS  requirements, 12 (52\%) do not meet EIS requirements due to individual deskstop applications (Excel) or don't have required functionality (training, user registries, industry codes). Only requirement, Noise mgmt, is entirely lacking. Some requirements, such as the Marine and Water Sample DBs, assume that the sections are using EQuIS. If they are not, then the functionality score drops to No.

\section{EIS analysis results}
Based on the roles and responsibilities of the different operational sections in Chapter 3, primary information systems requirements were determined and compared to existing applications. The requirements were scored based on adequacy of functionality to meet the section requirements. The scoring system used is shown in Table \ref{tab:funcclass}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Explanation of analysis discrepancies}

For some sections receiving a Partial rating with data visualization requirements, Tableau fulfills the data visualization portion of the requirements. The negative rating comes from the non-visualization requirement.

\subsubsection{Incident Reporting and Management System}
Current incidents, including hazardous material spills, venting and flaring are issued through mobile phone and WhatsApp messages from stakeholders the KEPA. While WhatsApp chats can be emailed, this system does not provide necessary information needed for historical tracking and later analysis. 

A basic incident management application is available on the Beatona website (\url{http://www.beatona.net/CMS/index.php}. The app allows an individual to identify a problem on a map, describe it and attached pictures of it. The map shows the status of reported incidents using a red-yellow-green indicators. The most current reported incident was submitted on 16 Jan 2013, forwarded to a department for action on 14 May 2014, and is still open. A screenshot the app is shown in FIgure \ref{fig:beatonat}.

\end{figure}
%

A spill reporting EDD was provided with the KEDD for EQuIS that included geospatial data of the spill, type of spill material, estimated quantity, responsible party, and time/date of the spill. It did not provide fields for other incidents such as flaring and tank venting, but could be altered to fit different requirements. The stakeholder completes the Spill Reporting sheet in the EDD and either checks it with the EDP or emails to the proper section for inclusion. A more comprehensive system may be web accessible, allow document attachments, tracking capabilities, task assignments, and pre-formatted reports.

\subsubsection{Compliance Mgmt System}
A key feature proposed in the CIMS project was the implementation of a permit system that established standards of performance for individual facilities regarding the allowable amount and concentrations of wastes, emissions, and discharges it could generate over a set time period. This requires a compliance management system to track facilities, permitted activities, milestone dates, inspection results, and follow-up actions. Even without the permitting, a central system is needed to track inspections and findings. The system should include standardized industrial codes and geospatial data to assist in visualizing and prioritizing audits. The system should also track the status of findings (open, closed, in progress), the category of the finding (waste, air, water), the impact of the finding (severe, minor), and concerned parties. The system should be linked with the Environment Police so they can access relevant information as well.

\subsubsection{Waste Management System}
Currently, waste is being tracked as hazardous, non-hazardous, and medical wastes with no differentiation of waste streams with the 3 categories. There is no registry of generators, transporters, or receivers aside from the licensed landfills. Receivers could also include industries accepting recyclable hazardous waste as feedstock.

\subsubsection{ODS tracking and management}
The current Electronic Services System is effective for supporting ODS trading. Linking to a portal at the port of entry for immediate access by on-site customs officers could improve efficiency and costs by saving trips back and forth to the KEPA offices by stakeholders. Missing functionality in the system includes lack of training records for certified ODS technicians, operating permits of ODS processes, and emission inventories of ODSs actually used.

\subsubsection{Chemical User  and Manufacturer Registry}
The Chemical Department should have a common registry of chemical types, quantities and bulk storage locations, in addition to bulk users. This should include a unique registration ID that is common for other KEPA functions like waste generation - user of hazardous materials usually generate hazardous wastes. The system should include geospatial data as well as industrial code classification. EQuIS could be used for this registry initially. Users and manufacturers would be added as facilities and instead of submitting samples would submit inventories on a monthly or annual basis. The registry should be part of or linked to the compliance management system to record operating permits and licenses associated with hazardous material use and storage.

\subsubsection{Organism Mgmt system}
The Conservation of Biodiversity Department uses Excel to store counts of different flora and fauna categories. An EDD using EQuIS can be easily prepared to handle the different raw data counts the sections generate. Using EQuIS allows all raw data and metadata to be captured and stored in a central schema that can be accessed by eMISK for specific analysis and reports.

\subsubsection{Water sample Mgmt system}
The Water Pollution Monitoring Department collects samples from several locations and tracks them through Excel. The department sections should be using EQuIS to submit field samples and assign a unique sample ID to each sample container. The sample ID is merged within EQuIS when the lab completes its analysis so that the results can be reviewed. Using EQuIS allows all raw data and metadata to be captured and stored in a central schema that can be accessed by eMISK for specific analysis and reports.

\subsubsection{Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)}
The Analytical Laboratory Department currently operates without a LIMS. This is very difficult to do considering the number of instruments, analytes, methods, and samples the labs are responsible for. A LIMS tracks chain of custody of samples, calibration and expiration dates of certificates, and generates result reports. Additionally it stores the collected data for historical use. A LIMS is not the same as EQuIS, although there are some common data sets. The most important difference is that the LIMS is unique to the individual lab. It captures internal data, not data from other sources. EQuIS captures data from many sources including external stakeholders and third party labs. The KEPA LIMS would have to prepare EDDs similar to other labs and submit to EQuIS. With a LIMS, the format can be automatic.

\subsubsection{Statistical data analysis}
As noted in the survey results in Chapter 3, there is a lack of advanced statistical analysis software available for use in the sections. This can be easily resolved by installing R (\url{https://www.r-project.org/}) and Rstudio (\url{https://www.rstudio.com/}) - both freely available for download . Microsoft SQL Server 2017 come with R pre-installed. This method requires training to use the various functions properly. Commercial packages such as Minitab and SPSS are also available in desktop and enterprise editions. These packages also require training to properly use. One advantage R has is that scripts can be written for routine tasks that can be run automatically. Additionally R can run complex data science and machine learning processes that packaged software cannot (or with limited options). A similar case can be made for Python.

\subsection{Collected Data and Metadata}
Different departments provide time series data to eMISK for consolidation and reporting. The reporting periods range from 1 month to near real-time (every 5 minutes). Examples of fields collected by these reports are shown in \ref{tab:emiskreports}. The reports use location codes to link to locations tables for mapping visualization. Additionally the tables assume that the data has already been checked and verified - consistent data - from the originated section. This includes making sure the data is in the proper units. Much of the metadata is lost when summary data is provided, such as date and time. However, metadata such as analysis methodology and sample collection method will be consistent for all samples, regardless of the summary statistical processing.

Table \ref{tab:emiskreports} shows that the source data is not readily available for historical analysis and must be extracted from individual Excel worksheets at the originating section. Additionally, the datasets are provided to eMISK via email attachments and must be manually processed by an eMISK analyst prior to uploading. 

One of the reasons that eMISK reports do do not report more metadata is that the data table submitted is not formatted properly. The data is submitted as a report as shown in Figure \ref{fig:treatedwater}. The variables are shown in a row as compared to columns, limiting the amount of data that can be included.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/treatedwater.png} 
\caption{Example of reported treated water effluent report.}
\label{fig:treatedwater}
\end{figure}
%
A more efficient way to show the same data would be to have only 4 columns: Location, Parameter, Result, and Unit. Each observation/chemical parameter value is a row \citep{Wickham2014}. As a comparison, the data collected using the KEDD format and available through EQuIS is shown in Table \ref{tb:kedd} in which the field names are columns and individual observations are rows. The sheets are linked by unique sample codes so that collected samples can be tracked independently from laboratory analysis if the samples are part of a quality control program and the source should be masked in order to prevent method bias.

Currently KNPC is submitting data to KEPA on discharged water quality on a monthly basis using the KEDD format.

\subsection{Category codes}

A key missing code for most data sources are industrial category codes such as the International Standard Industrial Code (ISIC) version 4 issued by the UN Statistic (\url{https://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/isic-4.asp}). This is the preferred standard from CSB. An ISIC is a 4 digit code that represents an industrial activity, such as 0610 - Extraction of crude petroleum. A company may have several activities, however, a specific process will be associated with only one code. The Public Authority for Industry list is only applicable to industries that manufacture items. It is also a long string based code that is difficult to use because of the lengths.

AQMIS has an SIC field for emission units that can accommodate ISIC, as well as source classification codes (SCCs) for processes. These codes allow easy sorting and querying for later analysis based on specific industries or processes.

The Environmental Planning and EIA department has developed its own list of industrial processes published in regulation (2 for 2015) Environmental and Social Impact Assessments. Coordination should be done to harmonize this list with a common KEPA list.

\subsection{Using social media as a data source}

The widespread use of internet connected portable electronic devices and social media applications allows the public to notice environmental concerns and discuss them without actually  reporting the incident to concerned authorities. While using crowd sourced data is not appropriate for requirements relying on precise results and specific metadata, there are several uses of crowd data generated from mobile devices that can assist environmental managers. 

Using sentiment analysis on services such as Twitter (\url{www.twitter.com}) and Facebook (\url{www.facebook.com}) can identify possible incidents or areas of concern that could be used a proactive mean to investigate compliance activities before they are officially reported.  By recognizing words, locations, hashtagged subjects and pictures, opens source chats can be analyzed and used to train environmental decision support systems (EDSSs) to recognize possible environmental incidents. This technique has been used to aid weather forecasts by confirming prediction accuracies and registering crowd densities for health studies\citep{Boulos2011, Weaver2016}. With low-powered sensors, mobile devices can become data collection platforms that can capture ambient air concentrations and record location, time and temperature. Consolidating data collected by multiple users, each in different areas, can be used to create an area wide concentration model that reflects variations in time and space \citep{Henriques2013}. 

The key to using social media is determining the desired outcomes and structuring the data collection system accordingly. Identifying which crowd to use and weighting results from those sources can provide more reliable data than treating all sources equally \citep{Comber2016}. This method of building user credibility is used by most subscription based services to provide feedback on users just as users provide feedback on the service. Users that consistently report validated events earn trust points in order speed up validation. This cannot be used as a substitute for actual reporting and investigation, but it can provide insight into situations that might otherwise go unreported.

\section{Analysis of air monitoring methods}

\subsection{Measurement technologies}

KEPA uses two different ambient air methodologies, chemiluminescence (CL) that measures photons generated by excited molecules, and differential optical absorption spectrometry (DOAS) that uses an open path sensor to measure absorbance of transmitted ultraviolet (UV) light. Most of the CL instruments are manufactured by Environnment SA (\url{http://www.environnement-sa.com/}) while the DOAS systems are provided by OPSIS AB (\url{https://www.opsis.se/}). The different systems processes are shown in Figure \ref{fig:airmonitors}.  Unlike the DOAS system the CL systems require a calibration gas, usually NO$_{2}$, to provide a reference for measurements.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/airmonitors.png} 
\caption[Process chart of air measurement technologies]{Process chart of (a) DOAS and (b) CL type air monitors for $O_{3}$ (Williams, 2006).}
\label{fig:airmonitors}
\end{figure}

%
KEPA operates 11 stations using CL technology and 2 stations using DOAS. A partial comparison of stations and the parameters they measure are shown in Table \ref{tab:ams}. While KEPA has 2 DOAS stations, KOC has installed 13 DOAS stations to monitor its emissions and impact to surrounding communities. Confirming that both methods report statistically similar readings is important to compare results, especially in areas suffering from non-attainment of the national air quality standards. Other studies showed that both systems provide similar readings and can be used interchangeably for O$_{3}$ and NO$_{2}$ \cite{Williams2006, Langridge2006}.

While DOAS systems use different methods to measure meteorological parameters, the stations come complete with weather sensors. 

\subsection{Unit conversion with pressure and temperature}
The CL stations are inconsistent in their measurement parameter, with only one station measuring atmospheric pressure (ATP). ATP is an important parameter required to convert the units recorded by KEPA in ppm and ppb to the more conventional $\mu g/m^{3}$. Air dispersion models generate units in $\mu g/m^{3}$ due to the necessary mass balance equations that are part of the calculation. The conversion from ppb to  $\mu g/m^{3}$ is given by 

%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gasequation}
C(ppb) = \frac{C(\mu g/m^{3})(R) (T)}{(P) (MW)}
\end{equation}
%

\noindent
where $C(ppb)$ is the gas concentration in $ppb$, $C(\mu g/m^{3})$ is the concentration in $\mu g/m^{3}$, $R$ is the ideal gas constant given as 8.3144 $m^{3}kPa K^{-1}mol^{-1}$, MW is the molecular weight of the gas in $g/mole$ (48.01 $g/mole$ for O$_{3}$), $T$ is the ambient temperature in degrees Kelvin, and $P$ is the atmospheric pressure at ground level in $kPa$.  If ATP is not provided, the conversion may yield wrong results. An example of the possible conversion error is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pressure} where the ATP ranges from 99 - 105 kPA, similar to that found in Kuwait. The possible outcomes range from 74 to 78 ppb. A shortcut using standard temperature (25 deg C) and pressure (101.3 kPA) gives a value of 76.4 ppb. This error range could be significant in areas suffering from non-attainment and being penalized by exceedances.

\label{fig:pressure}
\end{figure}
%
\subsection{Regional haze}
In addition to not having ATP monitors, most KEPA stations also do not have PM$_{2.5}$ monitoring equipment, and no station has PM$_{1}$ measurement capabilities (KEPA and KPC). PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{1}$ are widely considered to be generated by anthropogenic sources such as combustion by-products and aerosols from industrial processes \citep{Squizzato2016}.  Regular static sampling should be taken for analytical evaluation at an air lab for comprehensive look at air components. A major issue impacting Kuwait and other Gulf countries is regional haze. Studies show that overall visibility is degrading in the United Arab Emirates but do not identify causes and mitigations steps \citep{Amal2017}. The visibility is described as a mixture of fog, dust and industrial pollution. Various observations of the haze in Kuwait show that it is heaviest in the afternoon (characteristic of photochemical processes), limited to the mixing height of the atmosphere (approximately 150m), and white (suggesting it is nitrogen based, and not ozone - which is brownish) \citep{Liu2013}. To study this phenomenon, visibility sensors should be installed at air monitoring stations in addition to the pressure sensors.

\subsection{Statistical analysis of station parameters}
KEPA has three stations located in the Um-Al Heman area due to public concern including its 2 DOAS stations \citep{Carlisle2010} and the impact of pollution cycling from land-sea breeze effects \cite{Freeman2017}.  The relative proximity to each (1.1-1.6km from each other) makes this an ideal test environment to compare results and determine whether the two methods provide statistically similar results. The locations relative to each other are shown in Figure \ref{fig:stations}.

%
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

\caption{Locations of air monitoring stations in Um-Al Heman.}
\label{fig:stations}
\end{figure}
%
A null hypothesis, $H_{o}$ was established that the CL and DOAS systems measure the same parameters ($\mu_{1} = \mu_{2}$ within a level of significance equal to $p=0.05$). The two parameters to be evaluated are station temperature and O$_{3}$. Analysis was conducted using R ver 3.4.3 in RStudio ver 1.1.383 \citep{r2013}.

\subsubsection{Evaluation of station temperatures}
 The first test was to determine common meteorological measurements such as temperature.  The CL system is mounted on the top floor of the local MOH clinic, approximately 30m above ground level (AGL). The DOAS systems are mounted 10m AGL. Looking at data in boxplots in Figure \ref{fig:tempbox} show the data is similarly distributed with no outliers. Means (in $^{o}$C)  vary (CL = 25.97, DOAS1 = 26.96, and DOAS2 = 28.34).

%
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/tempbox.png} 
\caption{Boxplots of recorded station temperatures.}
\label{fig:tempbox}
\end{figure}
%

The first test is for homogeneity of variance between the different stations for temperature. The null hypothesis here is that variances are equivalent with a significance of p>0.05 using the Bartlett's K-squared test \citep{Mason2003}. The results using datasets from 2015 gives a Bartlett's K-squared = 9.0006, df = 2, p-value = 0.01111 < 0.05, thus rejecting or null and showing that the variance are not statistically similar. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is still applicable despite evidence of non-homogeneity. Homogeneous data sets are still assumed despite different numbers of missing data in each group (the CL set is missing 472, DOAS1 is missing 41, and DOAS2 is missing 8.).

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{Results of ANOVA test of station temperatures.}

\begin{tabular}{@{}cccccc@{}}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent
where \textbf{Df}  is the degree of freedom, \textbf{Sum Sq} is the deviance (within groups, and residual), \textbf{Mean Sq} is the  variance (within groups, and residual), \textbf{F value} is  the value of the Fisher statistic test (variance within groups) / (variance residual), and \textbf{Pr(>F)} is the calculated p-value. The low p-values are less than our level of significance (p>0.05) so  $H_{o}$ is rejected and the means of the station temperatures are assumed to not be statistically similar, even between the two DOAS stations. This negative finding for an easy to measure parameter such as temperature raises the issue regarding the level of maintenance and calibration of the measuring instruments. It also suggests that a common reading for meteorological parameters may not be appropriate for other stations in Kuwait. Case in point is the lack of atmospheric pressure sensors already discussed.  

\subsubsection{Evaluation of hourly ozone}
The ozone data was less Normally distributed than the temperature when summarized in boxplots of Figure \ref{fig:o3box}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Boxplots of 1hr average O$_{3}$.}
\label{fig:o3box}
\end{figure}
%
The stations show many potential outliers, which when looked at in histograms in Figure \ref{fig:o3hist} suggests that the extreme values are part of the underlying distributions.

\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/o3hist.png} 
\caption{Histograms of station 1hr average O$_{3}$.}
\label{fig:o3hist}
\end{figure}
%

Reviewing the data on histograms show that the data is heavily skewed to the left, implying a logarithmic distribution. Descriptive statistics of the data shown in Table \ref{tab:o3sets} show non-Normal skewing (N = 0) and kurtosis (N=3) values.
%
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Description of O$_{3}$ datasets.}
\label{tab:o3sets}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}

Mean & 16.59 & 34.45 & 25.25 \\
Skewness & 1.197 & 0.914 & 0.946 \\
Kurtosis & 4.76 & 4.16 & 4.2 \\
Missing & 705 & 137 & 45 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
%

Testing for  homogeneity of variance between the different stations yielded Bartlett's K-squared = 3034.1, df = 2, p-value < 2.2e-16, again failing our test significance of p>0.05. Homogeneity of data is also assumed despite the missing data. The ANOVA results are shown in Table \ref{tab:anovao3}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{ANOVA results for station 1 hr O$_{3}$. }
\label{tab:anovao3}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{CL} & \textbf{Df} & \textbf{Sum Sq} & \textbf{Mean Sq} & \textbf{F value} & \textbf{Pr(>F)} \\ \midrule
DOAS1 & 1 & 802662 & 802662 & 9728.5225 & \textless 2.2e-16 \\
DOAS2 & 1 & 712 & 712 & 8.6293 & 0.003318 \\
Residuals & 7906 & 652293 & 83 &  &  \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Again the null is rejected because the p-values are less than the level of significance. Transforming the data by taking the logarithm also does not improve the result enough. In order to transform the data, all 0's (censored data) had to be converted to a small value because log(0) is undefined. 

\subsubsection{Air methodology analysis summary}

For both parameters, the null hypothesises were rejected because the calculated p-values were less than the level of significance. This suggests that the stations do not provide similar results, both between the CL station and the DOAS stations, as well as between the DOAS stations. Explaining this discrepancy is not possible in this report but should be investigated. At the very least, the stations should record similar meteorological data. Because of the lack of significance between the DOAS stations, the lack of significance between the CL and DOAS stations cannot be considered sufficient reason to claim differences in measurement results. There are additional influences impacting the readings that must be identified and isolated if possible. A possible approach to resolving this issue is to have an independent mobile air lab sample at the same location and heights as the fixed systems for a short period of time and compare the results. If the results are similar at each site, then atmospheric phenomenon should be considered.

\section{Quality control and review}

While a full review of statistical methods and recommendations for data processes are out of scope of this report, some basic procedures should be applied for all data sets. The two most important tools for data visualization are histrograms and boxplots.  A histogram provides insight to the fundamental distribution of the dataset. Some software packages, such as DecisionTools (\url{www.palisades.com}) offer curve fitting applications that estimate a distribution based on the data. Boxplots allow immediate identification of possible outliers, even if the distribution is not inherently Normal. Figure \ref{fig:rawtc} shows raw data of Total colioform. Obvious outliers are present

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/tc-raw.png} 
\caption{Example of a boxplot with raw data showing potential outliers.}
\label{fig:rawtc}
\end{figure}

With the outliers removed , the boxplot in Figure \ref{fig:lessrawtc} still has many potential outliers and is heavily distorted.

\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth,keepaspectratio]{images/tc-lessraw.png} 
\caption{Example of a boxplot with initial outliers removed.}
\label{fig:lessrawtc}
\end{figure}

A histogram of the data in Figure \ref{fig:lessrawtc} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:histc}. A lognormal distribution curve has been fitted to the data showing that the data set is probably logarithmically distributed, especially since it is a large dataset (316 samples)

\section{Electronic decision support systems}
A key function of data collection and monitoring is to provide decision support for managers on critical or complex issues that normal summary data cannot fully represent. EDSSs often employ machine learning algorithms to handle different data sets using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. EDSSs have been effectively deployed to assist in water management in Lebanon \citep{Assaf2008}and waste water run-off in Italy \citep{Massei2014}.

Key to EDSS development is collection of good historical data sets required to train the systems and associated metadata to allow sufficient variance within the system to account for new input conditions. The inherent complexity with EDSSs dealing with multiple data streams, optimizing different constraints, and linking to actual physical systems makes developing and training the systems more difficult than non-EDSSs \citep{Swayne2000}. Using packaged EDSSs or relying on built-in functions can dramatically limit the supporting algorithms. With the many types of machine learning models available, selecting the optimum architecture becomes another challenge \citep{Massei2014}.

This difficulty is further exacerbated by the relatively few and randomly distributed events that EDSSs might be designed to assist in, such as a spill response. For events that happen rarely without a stochastic basis, training yields false responses as the system over-fits the existing training set and loses its flexibility to recognize new scenarios \citep{Goodfellow2016}.

If KEPA pursues EDSS technology to assist in it's management decision making processes, it should focus on data collection during the model development period in order to insure a sufficient training set is available. Because of the different models and resources available, pretty much any data and all data can be used for initial training, with subsequent pruning to enhance performance. In addition to collecting input data, output representing the results of the data must be identified and associated with the input sets. With machine learning, it is not important to know correlations between outputs and inputs because the program find the patterns.
